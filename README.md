<h1>Mile To Kilometer Converter</h1>

The Mile To Kilometer Converter is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python and the tkinter library. This converter allows you to input a distance in miles and instantly converts it into kilometers.

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 27.
